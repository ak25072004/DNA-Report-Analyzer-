# DNA-Report-Analyzer-
This project aims to automate and simplify DNA report comparison by implementing efficient data analysis algorithms. By extracting and analyzing DNA sequences from reports, we can identify similarities, mutations, or discrepancies, aiding in disease prediction, ancestry research, and forensic identification.


How can we efficiently compare DNA reports to detect similarities and differences for medical, forensic, or research purposes?

In todayâ€™s world, DNA analysis plays a crucial role in medical research, forensic investigations, and genetic studies. However, comparing DNA reports manually is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient. Current methods often require specialized knowledge and software, making them inaccessible to non-experts.
This project aims to automate and simplify DNA report comparison by implementing efficient data analysis algorithms. By extracting and analyzing DNA sequences from reports, we can identify similarities, mutations, or discrepancies, aiding in disease prediction, ancestry research, and forensic identification.
The importance of this project lies in its ability to enhance accuracy, save time, and make DNA analysis accessible to researchers, doctors, and forensic experts. By leveraging modern full-stack development technologies, this system will provide a user-friendly interface where users can upload DNA reports, process them in real time, and receive meaningful comparison results.
With automated DNA comparison, this project bridges the gap between complex genetic data and practical applications, contributing to advancements in healthcare, criminology, and biological research.
